Angela, 

Female Adoptions Case Manager, Northern GA.

**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using 2 Web sites that we’re reviewing so we can see whether they work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the sites, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.   First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

Adoption Case Manager.  

So, I work with children who are in foster care and they have a case plan of adoption and I work with foster parents and potential adoptive parents.  Sometimes biological parents. 

One of the most important things that I do is to visit my children monthly and that they are safe and that their needs are being met.  If the child is not legally free for adoption, then I will visit monthly with their biological parents. I also work with their providers to ensure that they are receiving the services that they need.  Also troubleshoot if they are having any concerns.  I attend court hearings nad work on making progress toward finalizing adoptions.

*In office vs. out of the office?*

I should do a time log to see how often I am in and out.  50/50.

*Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

If I work 40-50 hours a week, then I would say I might be using the internet 10-20 hours a week or more.  

*Any favourite sites?*

Pinterest. 

**Site Script:**

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.  **Let’s imagine our scenario is that you are a social worker who is trying to place a child with foster parents who need daycare in order to accept the placement.*

* First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

I really like that it reminds me of google because the search bar is so prominent.   I know what I’m supposed to do on this page.  I would enter zip code or address.

I can also see the initial words about finding more information.* *

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?*

Yes, I can easily access that information because I have all of that in our computer system SHINES (GA SACWIS).

*Where are you likely to be when you are doing this search?*

Most likely in the office.  

*What kind of computer do you have?*

A laptop.  Dell.  It’s pretty old but not too old.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

I would want to look it up first by zip or address, but also to see if they accept our state-payment (CAP).  Obviously if it’s safe or good reviews.

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next site.  This page is interactive, so you can use your mouse to move around and interact.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

User enters the zip and goes to the next page.  She would look for a licensed provider and I would be open to a home-based or daycare center.  (User is reading).  I’m not sure about the Quality Star Program.  

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

*Do you think you would do anything with those types of providers?*

I would click on them.

*Have to tell user to keep scrolling.*

So if I click on one those things would it filter it out more?  [User doesn’t think she’s clicked - she has - but the list is unfiltered/not working.]

*User scrolls right past the map.*

I would want the exact street address.  Because I would want to know where they are in proximity to the parents.

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

No I don’t think so.

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

I would call to find out more information.

*Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

No.  I would usually just try to find one match.

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*

I might look at the next closest zipcode.  (do you know where to enter that?)  Yes.  She scrolls up to the search area.  But then gets stuck accidentally zooming the map.  Map does something weird.  Can’t see anything.
