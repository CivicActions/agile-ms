Wanda, 

Female Resource Unit supervisor, GA.

Hi Wanda,

*Thank you so much for your willingness to speak with us again.*  *My main role here will be to give you some information up front, then to observe while you use a website that we’re currently testing. *

*	Your role is simply to use a website. We’re here today to test the website, not you! Just like last time - You can’t "fail" this test, or do anything wrong here. *

*The whole session should take at most 30 minutes. If you need to take a break at any point, please let me know.*

*	One of the best ways for you to help us during this test is to try to think out loud as much as possible. It’s particularly helpful if you tell us what you’re trying to do and what you’re looking at. It’s also helpful if you tell us when you’re confused or if something is unclear. Since our goal is to see how people use this website without someone there to guide them, I might not be able to clarify at the time, but knowing the questions you’re considering will be extremely helpful to us.*

*	You should even feel comfortable sharing these thoughts if they’re critical or harsh of the website. Please don’t worry about hurting my feelings. Remember our goal here is to find ways to improve this website, so we want to know your honest reactions.*

*	There will be some time at the end for you to ask any remaining questions, and I might ask you some questions. *

*	There are also some people observing this test on the phone. They’re here for the same reason I am: to improve the website. Don’t worry about them, they won’t be participating in the session at all, just observing.*

*	Do you have any questions so far?*

*Today, we will be working with some static images.  I’m going to ask you to play the role of social worker (or channel back to when you were in that role) in search of a daycare setting for a particular foster family in MS.   I will ask you to view one static image of a website at a time.  I will give you a task that I want you to try to complete - or more accurately, describe and use your mouse to show us how you would consider completing this task.  *

*Screen 1.*

*Please look at this screen and tell me what you would think to do on this screen.*

This looks like the MS Dept of HS and I should be able to find childcare providers in MS.  It says your zipcode or address(perhaps we need to add the word Enter).

[User does not see the information in the footer, because it is cutoff and below the fold. ]

*Can you scroll down?*

Reads the links - Parent guide would be info about childcare agencies, hopefully would give the parents info.  And would give them info about ratio (student to teacher, has it been rated, pickup dropoff, hours).  

Small on users screen.  I have a laptop - its new.  Dell. 

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next image.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

[User sees the types of providers.]

Are they licensed or unlicensed?  Will the state of MS have gone and checked out the home?  GA would not use unlicensed folks - because we can’t have our kids placed with people who are not licensed.  Regular mom and dads can do that.

If kids are in foster care, we can’t use unlicensed.  

*What would you do from here?*  

Click on one of those types.  And see if I can find out more information.  

[User clicks on one of the option, finds the tooltips.]

[User sees the search results on the lefthand side. ]

No it turns out that they are not filtered, why?

[User scrolls down under the fold and finds out how many results.]

Why would you put not rated names on there?  

*Can you see any information about ratings?*

Those stars are just giving me a definition.  I don’t understand where would I see about the ratings.  These all say not rated.  Why?  Are people not cooperative, is it because they are in the house?  I have questions I need answered from this list.

*What would you do next?*

I would click on Amanda Solares.  I don’t know why relative in-home is showing up.  Whose relative is she?  In home.  Is she coming into my home?

[User clicks onto Amanda result, but hyper link isn’t working, or the design treatment is misleading.]  

I still have the same questions.  Does she have kids in the home, does she have pets?  

[I ask the user to read the ratings section.]  

I don’t like that - it seems like you can choose whether to be licensed.  I like the learn more box.. I would look more into those (definitely as a social worker). [Those = quality star providers.]

*Any last comment? *

MS should not allow those daycare centers or foster kids to go in unlicensed daycare centers.  If that’s your own child, you do what you want.
